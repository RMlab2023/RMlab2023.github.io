We believe that science works best when it is open, rigorous, and accountable. Open Science is not just a policy compliance exercise for us — it is central to how we do research.

## Our Commitments

### Open Access Publishing

We make all of our publications freely available. Where possible, we post preprints to [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org) prior to or at submission, and we publish in open access journals or via green open access routes.

### Open Code

All analysis code associated with our publications is deposited in public repositories. We aim for code to be well-documented and reproducible by third parties.

### Open Data

Raw and processed datasets underlying our publications are deposited in appropriate public repositories under permissive licences.

### Data Management Plan

We write and adhere to data management plans. In the spirit of accountability, Dr. Madsen has made the data management plan accompanying her UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship publicly available — arguing that DMPs are too often treated as box-ticking exercises when they should be living documents that are regularly revisited.

## Research Integrity

Dr. Madsen was appointed in May 2022 to serve as a member of the UK's inaugural **Committee on Research Integrity (UK CORI)**, hosted by UKRI but operating independently. UK CORI is tasked with promoting research integrity nationally and internationally.

> "Research integrity is not simply a matter of not committing misconduct. It is about the culture we create: one that values rigour, transparency, and honest reporting of uncertainty."

## Community & Outreach

### FAIR Science Event (Edinburgh, 2021)

During her postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, Dr. Madsen organised a one-day research integrity event: *"FAIR Science: Tricky Problems and Creative Solutions"*, sponsored by the UK Biochemical Society and attended by approximately 100 people. The event led to the nucleation of a local network of Open Science champions.

### Science Communication

Dr. Madsen engages with the PROS patient community, communicating research findings in accessible language. She is committed to two-way dialogue with the communities affected by *PIK3CA*-related disease.
