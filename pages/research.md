## Overview

The Madsen Lab uses quantitative systems biology approaches to understand how cellular context shapes the output of oncogenic *PIK3CA* activation — with the ultimate goal of developing novel **state-gating** therapeutic strategies.

Our philosophy is rooted in information theory: to repair a broken signalling network, one must first understand how that network processes information in the normal state. As we describe to patient communities, fixing a *PIK3CA*-mutant cell is akin to repairing a broken radio — you need to understand the system before you can fix it.

## Research Questions

### 1. How does oncogenic PIK3CA corrupt the PI3K signalling code?

Class IA PI3Ks are central transducers of growth factor signalling. The p110α catalytic subunit, encoded by *PIK3CA*, is among the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer, with activating mutations found across breast, endometrial, and colorectal cancers, as well as in overgrowth disorders such as PROS (PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum).

We are interested in understanding at a quantitative level how disease-associated, activating mutations in p110α change the information-processing properties of the PI3K network — moving beyond simple "more or less activity" towards a systems-level understanding of how signalling logic is altered.

### 2. How does cellular context shape oncogenic PI3K output?

The same *PIK3CA* mutation can drive very different biological outcomes depending on the cell type in which it occurs. A mutation that promotes proliferation in one context may drive differentiation defects or metabolic reprogramming in another.

We use iPSC-derived cellular models and primary cell systems to systematically probe how cell state, lineage identity, and microenvironmental context determine the biological consequences of oncogenic PI3K activation.

### 3. Can we exploit context-dependent vulnerabilities therapeutically?

Understanding why the same mutation has different consequences in different contexts opens the door to **state-gating**: therapeutic strategies that exploit the fact that only certain cellular states are vulnerable to a given drug or intervention.

This is particularly exciting in the context of PROS, where mosaic activating *PIK3CA* mutations drive tissue overgrowth — and where selective targeting of affected cell states could achieve therapeutic benefit while minimising off-target toxicity.

## Approaches & Technologies

We combine wet-lab and computational approaches, including:

- **Single-cell quantification** of the cellular transcriptome and signalling activity as a function of time
- **iPSC-derived cellular models** to study context-dependent PI3K signalling across relevant cell types
- **Genetic engineering** for precise *PIK3CA* mutations knock-in, installation of barcodes and inducible genetic perturbations
- **Computational modelling** of signalling network dynamics and gene regulatory network states

## Funding

The Madsen Lab's primary funding is from a **UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship (Round 8)**, awarded to Dr. Ralitsa Madsen in November 2024. The fellowship supports research into mapping the context-dependent PI3K signalling code in health and disease, and contributes to the development of state-gating therapies.

## Patient & Public Involvement

We actively engage with the PROS patient community, recognising that their lived experience of *PIK3CA*-related disease is invaluable for shaping the direction of our research. We are committed to communicating our findings in accessible language and to incorporating patient perspectives into our scientific priorities.
