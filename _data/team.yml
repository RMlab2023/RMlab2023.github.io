  bio: >
    Ralitsa is a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow (round 8). Her research
    focuses on the quantitative systems biology of PI3K signalling and on developing
    state-gating therapeutic approaches. She completed her Wellcome Trust-funded PhD
    at the Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge (2015–2018), followed by a
    Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship at UCL Cancer Institute. She is an avid 
    Open Science chmapion and serves on the UK Committee on Research Integrity (UK CORI).
