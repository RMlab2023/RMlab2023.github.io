# Giving it back

It is hard to believe, but it is now almost a year since I got the fantastic news that my **Future Leaders Fellowship application (Round 8)** had been successful. I had promised myself that I would share some of my learnings with future applicants — whether or not I got the Fellowship. So here I am, writing up what I should have put together already a year ago. Apologies for the delay, but time and energy turned out to be limiting resources after a whirlwind of a year.

## Why a recipe?

I have decided to structure this guiding post as a **cooking recipe**. Now, remember that you are free to ignore all of it — there are many paths to success. This is just my personal experience, and some context is probably key to share upfront.

I am a **biomedical scientist**, with a strong passion for advancing a quantitative approach to understanding and treating diseases of aberrant cell communication.

As I was applying for the FLF, I still had 1.5 years left of my **Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship**. I had started this fellowship at **UCL**; however, halfway through, I got an opportunity to start my independent lab at the **MRC PPU in Dundee**, so I moved.

This meant that, by the time I was given the opportunity to apply for the FLF, there was **only one month to go** to submission — a place had just been freed up as another candidate was successful with a separate fellowship application.

In other words, because I had not yet arrived at the University of Dundee when the internal FLF candidate selection took place, my actual application journey was **very unusual** and perhaps **excessively stressful** for the same reason. But hey, I got it — so here is the wisdom I can share!

My success was really all down to ensuring that all the below **ingredients** were in place when I got the opportunity. You will hopefully get the opportunity with **plenty of time** to secure all ingredients if you do not have them already.

## My FLF ingredients list

### 1. A strong vision

- This is **key**. Practise articulating your vision out loud and imagine being an external listener. Ask yourself:
- *“So what? Why fund this? Who cares?”*
- If you can give a convincing and pithy answer, you’ve nailed it.
- Think beyond your own research agenda:
- Is it clear that your vision has the potential to be transformative in terms of understanding and/or application?
- Is it clear how the delivery of your programme will add value to UK R&D?
- *Hint: check key strategy documents from UKRI and the UK Government to understand what their priority areas are and how you may contribute — be specific.*
- Be prepared to articulate the kind of (big) change — in research and in your career — an FLF will enable **4, 7, 10+ years from now**.
- Final tip: think of ways in which your interdisciplinary research vision naturally ties in with aspects of **research culture** that UKRI care about (e.g. highly interdisciplinary project, team science, recognition of diverse skillsets, and career development for trainees).

### 2. Prior impact in research and beyond

- What have you done so far to evidence your **future leader potential**?
- This is tough — but you need to demonstrate credentials in research and beyond:
- Demonstrable **research impact**
- Engagement with **research culture**, **open science**, and related efforts — not as box-ticking, but because you care about doing better research
- Strong examples of how you support team development, inspire leadership, and ensure a **welcoming and open environment**
- Familiarise yourself with the **FLF Development Network** and the ways you’ll benefit from it — be genuine and specific.

### 3. A realistic plan

You’ve got your vision — now, how are you going to deliver it?

- The plan must be **realistic** and convey long-term potential.
- Consider:
- Key experiments/models and who/what is needed
- Short-, mid-, and long-term deliverables
- Clear work packages/aims — are they **independent enough** to allow progress if one fails?
- Success measures
- Risk management strategies
- Above all, show how your plan can **only be delivered through the FLF mechanism**:
- The long-term support, skill-building, and integration you propose wouldn’t be possible via multiple, smaller grants.

### 4. Big picture overview

- Know your field inside-out.
- Why is your research competitive?
- What makes your programme **unique**?
- Are you sure you’ve considered all alternative methods/approaches?
- Acknowledge strengths and limitations — it builds trust.

### 5. The right host institution

- The ideal host should offer:
- The right **research culture**
- Tangible support for **you and your team**
- A lab and office are fine — but the **bare minimum**.
- The stronger their support, the more they demonstrate belief in **you as an investment**.
- Show why this institution is the one to help you **deliver your vision**.

### 6. Strong collaborators

- Similar to the host institution, your collaborators must:
- Provide support in areas where **you’re less experienced**
- Offer tangible, ideally **in-kind** support
- Their letters should be **genuine and personal** — showing real belief in you.
- Don’t name-drop — symbolic collaborations will hurt your application.
- Articulate how you’ll **manage the collaboration**:
- Site visits?
- Virtual meetings?
- Exchange arrangements?
- Fit this into your **justification for resources**, too.

### 7. Good mentor(s)

- You’ll need mentors for both your career and your FLF journey.
- Think about the **type of mentorship** you need:
- Expertise? Support navigating identity and career? Strategic advice?
- For example, I chose a **female mentor** who shared my cultural background. Her experience and understanding were key.

### 8. Supportive colleagues

- You’ll need them — inside and outside your institution.
- Get feedback from:
- **Colleagues outside your field** — your panel may be generalist
- **Experienced reviewers** — ideally with UKRI panel experience
- Ask colleagues to read your application with a **devil’s advocate** lens.
- Share your rebuttal letter. Do **mock interviews** — many, not just one or two.
- Accept feedback, even when it stings. **You need this** to improve.
- One of the biggest mistakes? Not being open to feedback, or leaving it too late.

### 9. A robust budget

- Get your costings right — **early**.
- Work closely with your **research finance team**.
- Justify everything clearly.
- Be aware of **conditions on large requests**, e.g. capital equipment may require a business case (I had to write one!).

### 10. Successful prior application examples

- Learn from others — especially recent ones.
- What patterns do you notice in strong applications?
- Vision
- Impact
- Clarity
- Don’t copy, but do take inspiration.

## Assembling the proposal

Once you have your ingredients, you’ll need to **mix them just right**.

- Write with **clarity of thought** — not easy!
- Be prepared to go through **10+ versions** before submission.
- You won’t be able to cover everything — there’s an art to **selecting what matters most**.
- Every paragraph should support one or more **FLF assessment criteria** — memorise them and **cut anything that doesn’t help**.
- Reviewers understand the space limitations — so think creatively:
- Use visuals
- Be concise
- Get others to help prune unnecessary details

## The interview

If you get this far — **congratulations!** You’ve already done brilliantly.

Use the month before your interview **strategically**.

- Don’t stop at two mocks — do several.
- Assign different focus areas to each practice session.
- Your slides must be **crystal clear** — ideally, your vision is self-explanatory.
- I reworked mine completely after the first mock!
- Practise your **5-minute pitch** relentlessly — but don’t sound like a robot.
- My non-English-speaking mother was visiting the week before my interview. I dragged her on long walks along the Tay river and delivered my pitch on repeat.
- Be authentic, passionate — and prepared.
- Study UKRI’s **interview guidance** and **example questions**. They may not ask them word-for-word, but the themes will appear. **Prepare answers in advance**.

## Final thoughts

I wish you all the best of luck — you’ve got this!
